    This context manager can be used to run code that needs the rest of the app
    to be locked down. The context manager throws a ``LockFailureError``
    exception if the lock cannot be acquired after the specified number of
    attempts.

    Lock is automatically released when execution exists the context. Raising
    exceptions inside the context will not release the lock, however. The
    ``always_release`` argument can be used to change this behavior. Exception
    from within context is always reraised regardless of whether lock is
    released or not.

                            ``LockFailureError``
