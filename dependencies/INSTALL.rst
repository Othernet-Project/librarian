About requirements.txt
======================

The requirements.txt found in this directory contains a full list of
depedencies generated by ``pip freeze``-ing a working installation. It is
intended to be used as a source for generating a local PyPi mirror containing
all packages necessary to get Librarian deployed on a local machine.

Creating a local PyPi mirror
============================

To create a local PyPi mirror, you need to first install the pip2pi package. ::

    $ pip install pip2pi

Next decide where you want to keep the local repository. In our example, we
will use ``/tmp/pypi``. (Mind the line continuation!) ::

    $ pip2pi --normalize-package-names /tmp/pypi --no-deps --no-binary :all: \
    > -r path/to/dependencies/requriements.txt

Using the local mirror
======================

To install packages from the local mirror, use the following command::

    $ pip install <req> --extra-index-url file://<mirror path>
